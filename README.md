# Odin Project Flickr API

This is a project for The Odin Project to create a quick test of the Flcikr API. You can access the original project description [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/apis). 

This could be improved in a number of ways:
* Tests 
* Bringing in thumbnails as opposed to full sized images for the "gallery"
* Using a pagination or limiting of queries to a certain number
* Make it responsive
